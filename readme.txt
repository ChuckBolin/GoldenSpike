Drew and Jon,

Instructions are in the game...accessible from the main menu. READ all
the Help screens before playing. They're easy to read.

The game is loaded from assets\\data\\level1.dat.  This is the complete level.
For TESTING you could rename level1_test.dat as level1.dat to remove the rocky
hills and to allow for quicker testing (winning).

I can say that most of the art is mine and so are the
sound effects.  The game is much friendlier than my
previous entries.

Fullscreen is 'iffy' so I allow for windowed mode.

Playing a new game or saved game is offered at the beginning
but should be available in the menu. I would have done
this but I needed to program a menu window for fullscreen,
again no time.

Game play can be saved and resumed.

That's about it.  Thanks,
CHuck
